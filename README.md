## Introduction
Bullying, an intentional, aggressive, and repetitive behavior, has taken on a digital form known as cyberbullying. The prevalence of social media and the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic have led to a surge in cyberbullying incidents. This modern form of aggression can impact individuals of any age, anytime, and anywhere. The anonymity provided by the internet further complicates efforts to combat cyberbullying compared to traditional bullying.

## Statistics
- **UNICEF Warning (April 15th, 2020):** Highlighting the increased risk of cyberbullying.
- **Times Of India Report (2021):** 52,974 reported cybercrime incidents in India.
- **Indian Children:** Approximately 85% reported being victims or perpetrators of cyberbullying.
- **General Population:** Nearly 8 out of 10 individuals in India experience various forms of cyberbullying, with 63% facing online abuses and insults, and 59% falling victim to false rumors and gossip damaging their image.

To address this issue, our project aims to raise awareness about cyberbullying and implement preventative measures, creating a safe environment free from the fear of online harassment.
